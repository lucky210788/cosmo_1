        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Information we get from external companies (third party sources)</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">To help us comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, when you open your account we request a check up on information from Thomson Reuters. This portal keeps records of any positive or negative information on individuals (if those are official). This helps the Company to minimize any potential risks and keep crime out of betting industry. We may also collect information from third parties such as our affiliates, service providers and publicly available sites (ie, social platforms), to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, to offer Services that we consider to be of interest, to maintain accuracy of the data, and to provide and improve the Services. Sometimes we need to undertake additional checks to verify information or, once an account is active, to investigate activity that could indicate a risk. To do this we use organizations and databases which collate information and make it commercially available for use in crime prevention and detection, the promotion of safer gambling and ensuring the fair use of services. We also look at publicly available information to verify things like occupation status or property ownership, and at social media.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Publicly available information</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">If you would like to know more about gambling regulation and the obligations it places on companies like VipKing.com, you can find out more content on Safer Gambling websites.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Information we get from social media</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">We look at information on your Facebook or other public social media pages when carrying out checks to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. This helps us to verify information you have given us and ensure our products are being used legally and responsibly.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">How and why we use your personal information</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">We use the information we hold about you in a range of different ways, which fall into these broad categories:

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Meeting our Obligations Legal and Regulatory Requirements</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">We need to comply with a range of legal and regulatory requirements, some of which involve the use of personal information and/or set out timescales for which we need to keep that information. As a provider of betting services, we are regulated by the Gaming Curaçao. We take our social responsibility and our commitment to safer gambling very seriously and we actively look for behaviour that may indicate that someone is at risk of problem gambling so that we can intervene at an early stage to provide them with support and direct them to sources of help. To help us understand the factors that can indicate the early stages of problem gambling, we look at information about customers who have self-excluded, such as age, location and past betting behaviour, to identify common factors. This helps us intervene earlier in cases where customers may be at risk of problem gambling and provide them with better support. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to other aspects of our business, such as payment processing or complaint handling and some of these too involve the use of, or set timescales for holding, your personal information.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Fraud, Money Laundering and Other Illegal Activity</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">When you set up an account with us, place bets we carry out identity verification, fraud prevention and anti-money laundering checks, validating the information you give against third party crime prevention databases and, where necessary, information from publicly-available sources. We share your personal data with organisations that verify details and transactions and identify potential indicators of illegal activity, which they make available to other organisations using their services. Where necessary, we share your data with Risk Intelligence agencies or fraud prevention agencies, which keep a record of that information and make it available to other organisations for use in identification checks and fraud detection and prevention. Where appropriate, we pass information to the police and other law enforcement agencies, debt recovery companies and other similar bodies. As well as fraud and money laundering, we carry out ongoing monitoring to ensure that our products and services are not used for other Illegal purposes such as event manipulation, “match-rigging” or other forms of cheating. We do this in a variety of ways, including the use of cookies, and where we find transactions, data or behaviour that could indicate illegal activity we share information with third parties, including the police.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Privacy Rights: Can I object to having my personal information used in this way?</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">This category covers activities we are obliged to do in order to provide our products and services legally, responsibly, and in line with the requirements of our regulators, and ultimately to protect our customers and our business. We cannot provide you with our products and services without carrying out these activities, and if you don’t want your data used in this way your option is to not use our services and close your account.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Running our business effectively and efficiently</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">There are some things we do to help us operate as a commercial organisation. We have a legitimate interest in carrying out these activities, and where they involve using your personal information we are careful to carry them out in a way that minimizes any impact on your privacy. Data protection law gives you the ‘right of objection’ to the activities in this category if your right to privacy outweighs our legitimate business interest in doing them. You always have the option to exercise this right but, as we explain in more detail below, the activities involved are central to our business, so if you wish to do so it will usually mean you need to close your account. Please read this section carefully and ensure you are happy with it before providing us with your personal information.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Business Insights</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">We carry out basic analytics to help us understand, how, when, where and why our customers use our services, and how our business is performing. This helps us monitor and plan everything from the effectiveness of our advertising through to ensuring we have enough staff available to handle queries at peak times. It also gives us a much clearer picture of our customers generally, the broad demographic groups they fit into (e.g. age group, gender, location, etc.) and the products and services they use, which in turn helps us to develop better and more relevant features, products and services.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Privacy Rights: Can I object to having my personal information used in this way?</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">Like any business, we need to keep a close eye on how our business is performing and whether we’re meeting the needs of our customers. As we do this in a way that does not identify you as an individual, there is no impact on your privacy. If you don’t want your data used in this way your option is to not use our services and close your account.
        </p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Protecting our commercial interests</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">Most people use our products and services fairly, but we carry out monitoring of how our customers bet, play and interact with our products and services, to identify behaviour that is not in line with our Terms and Conditions or that could be prejudicial to our commercial interests. At our discretion, we have the right to use this information in making decisions about whether to place restrictions on people’s accounts or, on very rare occasions, to close their accounts. We take this very seriously, and consider a wide variety of factors in making such a decision, taking into the information we hold about you as well as any information obtained from industry databases. Please note that we do not use cookies to obtain information for this purpose.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Privacy Rights: Can I object to having my personal information used in this way?</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">As a business, we have a legitimate interest in protecting our commercial interests against deliberate misuse, and we are confident that we do it in a way that is proportionate to the risks we face and has minimal impact on your privacy. If you don’t want your data used in this way your option is to not use our services and to close your account.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Things we do with your consent: Marketing</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">We will send you offers and information only if you have given your consent for us to do so, in which case we will contact you via email, post, SMS or online about any of our group products and services. We never share your data with companies outside our group for them to use for their own marketing. From time to time, we may team up with a third party to bring you details of a product or service we think might interest you, but where we do this the contact will come from us - we will never pass your details to the third party without your prior consent. Please be assured that we do not use any sensitive information we hold about you (for example, information about self-exclusion, health or ethnicity) for marketing-related purposes.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Keeping it Relevant</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">At VipKing.com we want to make betting better for you, so we want to be able to tell you about products, services and features that you will find exciting and relevant, and we tailor the offers and information we send to suit you. To do this, we look at what we know about you - such as your age, location and gender, your betting interests, your social media usage and how you interact with us - and we use it to build up a picture of you that helps us decide what you’re most likely to want to hear about. (This is sometimes known as ‘Profiling’). We also combine this with information we’ve obtained from publicly or commercially available sources about the things people with similar characteristics to you (in terms of age, gender, location etc.) tend to be interested in so we can fine-tune the offers we present to you.

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Putting you in Control</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text">We firmly believe our customers prefer offers and information that are relevant to them and their interests over general adverts, so we tailor all our marketing using this picture we’ve built up of you. We think this makes our marketing better both for you and for us. However, data protection law gives you the right to opt out of having your personal data used to build up this type of picture and predict what you might be interested in, so you can opt out at any time. As we explain above, all our marketing is tailored to you in this way, so to opt out of this type of personalisation you will need to opt out of receiving all direct marketing from us. You can do this when you sign up, by not ticking the box to opt in to marketing, or at any later point via your online account. We won’t then send you offers and information by post, email or SMS but we will continue to personalise your online experience based on the picture we’ve built up of you. This means you’ll continue to benefit from a more personalised look and feel on our websites and apps, and will still see the following:</p>
        <ul class="text-list">
            <li class="content-page__text">Targeted pop-ups telling you about products, services and offers we think you’ll like</li>
            <li class="content-page__text">Bespoke offers relevant to you, communicated through pop-ups or other on-site content</li>
            <li class="content-page__text">Targeted messages on social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter (which you can control easily through your privacy settings on each individual platform) and in other places on the internet that support targeted advertising.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content-page__text">We think this strikes the best balance: it lets you opt out of receiving marketing through offline channels (post, email and SMS) while still enjoying the best online and in-game experience and without having to miss out on bonuses, promotions and other benefits. However, if you prefer not to receive any personalised messages or offers online you can opt out by out by editing your account details via your online account. If you do opt out you will experience a less personal look and feel on our sites and apps and won’t get to hear about bespoke offers and bonuses. Please also note the following:</p>
        <ul class="text-list text-mb">
            <li class="content-page__text">Some personalised banner adverts on our sites are controlled separately through cookies, so you will also need to adjust your browser’s cookie settings or you will continue to see them.</li>
            <li class="content-page__text">You may still see our adverts on other websites or social media platforms you visit, but these will not be specifically targeted at you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Marketing: Keeping it relevant and putting you in control - At a Glance:</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text">All our marketing is tailored to be more relevant and interesting to you, so if you’re:</p>
        <ul class="text-list">
            <li class="content-page__text">Happy to receive personalised offers and information by email, post, SMS and online – make sure you opt in to direct marketing</li>
            <li class="content-page__text">Happy to see personalised offers and information when you’re online but don’t want to receive them by email, post or SMS – you need to opt out of direct marketing</li>
            <li class="content-page__text">Not happy to see personalised offers and information online or by e-mail, post or SMS – be sure to opt out of personalised marketing and adjust your cookie settings to avoid receiving banner adverts</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">Remember, you can change your mind at any time by updating your preferences in your account.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Online banner adverts: cookies</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text">If you have enabled cookies in your browser you may receive banner adverts on our homepage, as these are cookie-based and not tailored using other information we hold about you. As they are cookie-based you will receive them even after you have opted out of personalised marketing, but you can control them easily via your browser settings
            Advertising on Social Media</p>
        <p class="content-page__text">If you have given your consent to marketing, we will work with social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter to provide you with information about our products and services via their platforms. If you do not wish to see these adverts, you can control this easily by disabling preference-based marketing in the privacy and ad settings on each individual platform. Even if you have withdrawn your consent to personalised marketing by VipKing.com, you might still see general adverts for VipKing.com products and services on your social media feeds. These will not be specifically targeted to you, and again, you can control this via the privacy and ad settings on each platform.</p>
        <p class="content-page__text">Marketing on our apps: Push Messages</p>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">When using our apps, you will receive push messages. These can be easily disabled through your phone or device’s settings.
        </p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Privacy Rights: Can I opt out of marketing?</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">Yes, you have the right to opt out of having your information used for direct marketing and the right to opt out of having it used to build up a picture of you so we can personalise our marketing to suit you. Please read the sections headed ‘Keeping it relevant and keeping you in control’, which explain how we use your personal data in our marketing, and how to control the marketing you see, and remember you can change your mind about receiving marketing material at any time via your VipKing.com account. As our marketing campaigns are prepared well in advance, you are likely to continue to receive material for a short period of time after updating your preferences.
            Remember, even if you choose not to receive marketing email, we may continue to send you important service information related to your accounts and subscriptions. More sensitive matters: how we use sensitive data
            As a responsible provider of betting services, we do our best to ensure that our customers bet responsibly, and encourage you to make use of the range of tools available to help you with this. This means that on occasion you may provide us, directly or indirectly with information about your physical, psychological or emotional health or situation and talk to us about problems with gambling. We appreciate the sensitivity of this information and use it only to provide you with the support you have asked for and to signpost you to the appropriate sources of help. To help us in our commitment to safer gambling, it’s important that we understand the factors that can lead people to self-exclude or may indicate the early stages of problem gambling. Where a customer self-excludes, we look at demographic information about them (such as age group and location) and their past betting behaviour and transactions to help us identify common factors. This in turn helps us to provide earlier and better support to customers who may be at risk of problem gambling. As well as ensuring we do all we can to fulfil our regulatory obligations, it helps us to help our customers gamble responsibly. On occasion, you may provide us, usually indirectly, with other sensitive information about yourself, such as your ethnicity or nationality (for example, identity verification documentation or checks can reveal this information). It is rare for us to ask you for this type of information directly, and we will only do so if we have a specific and valid legal reason, which we will explain clearly at the time. Where we do need to hold this type of sensitive information because it is shown in an identification document for example, we will do so only to comply with our legal or regulatory requirements and will not use or make it available for any other purpose. Where you provide us with details of, or a copy of, your passport, driving licence, national identity card, or other national identification documentation, we use it only for identification and verification purposes required to fulfil our legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Other circumstances in which we share your personal data</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">Apart from the functions set out above, we do not share your personal information with third parties except where we are compelled or permitted by law to do so. These circumstances are rare, but may require us to share information with the police or other law enforcement agencies, the courts, statutory authorities (e.g. in connection with tax matters). Where necessary to protect or defend our rights and interests, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements, we will share personal data with our regulators, external legal advisors and debt recovery and tracing agencies, although again these circumstances are rare. If ownership of all or part of our business changes or we undergo a reorganisation or restructure, we will transfer your personal information to the new owner or successor company so we or they can continue to provide the services you have requested. The following measures can be performed only with your explicit consent. Whenever we share personal information, and whatever the reason or circumstances, we will always do so legally and with due regard to your privacy. If we receive a request from law enforcement or other statutory bodies, we do not disclose personal information without a warrant, court order or other legally valid proof of authority.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">How long do we keep your information?</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">We hold your personal information only as long as we have a valid legal reason to do so, which includes providing you with the services you have requested, meeting our legal and regulatory obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements. The length of time for which we keep different types of personal information can vary, depending on why we originally obtained them, the reason we process them and the legal requirements that apply to them. Your personal data will be maintained for the period of at least 5 years since the date of the last transaction made on your account. Your personal data may be destroyed after the period of 5 years, since a last transaction will pass and the approval by the Authority will be granted. When setting our data retention and deletion timescales we take into account a range of factors including applicable regulations and standards relating to gambling, anti-money laundering, taxation, payment processing and complaint handling, the need to prevent or detect crime or other misuse of our services, and audit requirements. To fulfil our requirements, some of your personal data will need to be retained for a period of time after you cease to be a customer. When we no longer need it to fulfil the above requirements, we delete it securely. Please note that if you opt out of receiving marketing from us, we will still need to keep your contact details in order to suppress them from future marketing activity.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Staying in control of your Personal information: Your Privacy rights</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">We respect the fact that your personal information is your information so we want to be clear about what those rights mean in practice and how you can exercise them. Please see ‘how and why we use your data’ for more information about the purposes for which we process your information and the rights this gives you.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">The right to opt out of having your information used for marketing</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text">You can opt out of receiving marketing at any time. You also have the right to opt out of having your information used to create a ‘profile’ of you for marketing purposes. We firmly believe that our customers prefer to receive offers and information that are relevant to them so we tailor all of our marketing to make it more interesting to our customers. Please read the section ‘Keeping it relevant and putting you in control’ for more details.</p>
        <p class="content-page__text">The right to have any inaccuracies in your personal information corrected You can update your personal details at any time via your online VipKing.com account. Please help us to help you by keeping your contact details up to date and letting us know if you spot any errors in the information we hold about you. If it is something you cannot correct yourself online, you should contact us at support@VipKing.com. We’ll update inaccuracies promptly, and within a month if you are requesting a more complex change. If we take the decision not to make a change you have requested, we will explain why and make a note on your account to show that you requested the change. If you disagree with our decision, you have the right to complain to the Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection.</p>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">Your ‘right of objection’ to certain activities Data protection law gives you the right to express an objection to activities detailed in the section entitled Running our business effectively and efficiently if you believe your privacy rights outweigh the legitimate interest we have as a business in doing those things. Please read that section carefully before getting in touch with us and note that exercising your right of objection will usually mean you need to close your account and stop using our services. If you disagree with our decision on this, you have the right to complain to the to the Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Your Right to Erasure</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text">People sometimes refer to this as the ‘right to be forgotten’. Under data protection law, you have the right to request erasure of your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul class="text-list text-mb">
            <li class="content-page__text">Where the courts or our regulators have found us to be processing it unlawfully;</li>
            <li class="content-page__text">Where our original purpose for collecting the data has been completed and we have no other valid legal grounds for continuing to hold it;</li>
            <li class="content-page__text">Where you have withdrawn your consent to marketing and personalised marketing and asked us to delete the information we previously used for those purposes, in which case we will either delete it from our marketing systems or fully anonymise it, but note that we will retain your contact details in order to prevent further marketing;</li>
            <li class="content-page__text">Where you have successfully exercised your ‘right to object’ to one of the activities in the section entitled running our business effectively and efficiently and asked us to delete the information we used for that purpose. As we explain in that section, exercising your right to object will usually mean closing your account, and note that in most cases we will need to retain your information for a period of time after your account is closed. We will not delete information as long as we still have a valid legal or regulatory reason to hold it, unless the courts or our regulators order us to do so.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">How do I exercise this right?</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">Please read the sections entitled ‘How long do we keep information’ and ‘your right to erasure carefully before contacting us. If you still wish to exercise your right, you should contact us at privacy@VipKing.com and we will respond to your request within a month and without undue delay. If we uphold your request and erase your data we will also notify any third parties to which the data has been passed, where we are able to do so, and tell you who they are. If we do not uphold your request, we will tell you why. If you disagree, you have the right to complain to the to the Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection. The right to access the data we hold about you If you would like a copy of the personal information we hold about you, you should request it here. We will ask you to complete and return a form, which is not compulsory but helps us to help you by providing the information you are looking for. Before we respond to your request, we will ask you for valid proof of identity and once we’ve received it we will provide our response within one month. If your request is unusually complex and likely to take longer than a month, we will let you know as soon as we can and tell you how long we think it will take. We will fulfil requests wherever possible, but there are occasional situations in which local or general data protection regulation (GDPR) 2016/679 requires or permits us to withhold some information (such as where it would involve disclosing information about another person or information which is commercially sensitive) or permits us to make a small charge. If either of these applies, we will explain this to you.</p>

        <h3 class="content-page__subtitle">Your Right to ‘Data Portability’</h3>
        <p class="content-page__text">The right to ‘data portability’ aims to enable consumers to re-use some of their personal information online by making it available in a commonly-used, machine-readable format that can be passed to and used by other organisations. This is a new initiative and it is not yet possible to ‘port’ data directly between providers in the betting and gaming industry. However, if you wish to exercise this right, you should submit your request here, and we will provide you with the following information as a CSV file:</p>
        <ul class="text-list">
            <li class="content-page__text">the personal and contact details held in your online account
            your betting history</li>
            <li class="content-page__text">A list of payments made and funds withdrawn</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content-page__text text-mb">Before responding to your request, we will ask you to provide valid proof of identity, and we will provide our response within one month of receiving it. If you believe your privacy rights have been infringed, or you disagree with a decision we have made about your privacy rights, you have the right to complain to the privacy regulator. As we are based in Cyprus, our principal data protection regulator is the Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection.</p>
